**Getting Started**

* Run cmd: `make all` in the Terminal. This should create the Kafka Broker service and start the FastAPI service, as mentioned in the Makefile.
* Open the browser and hit the url: https://0.0.0.0:8080/. This will open the Swagger documentation.
* Or directly use the GET endpoint: https://0.0.0.0:8080/user/{user-id} For demo, user-id can be 81325.
